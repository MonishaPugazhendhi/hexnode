# Hexnode Android MDM Solution Clone

This project is a recreation of the Hexnode Android MDM Solution webpage. The webpage was built using React as part of an interview assessment. The objective was to replicate the page’s layout, responsiveness, styling, and interactive features.

The goal was to closely match the design of the Hexnode Android MDM Solution webpage while ensuring:

Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
Interactive elements such as sliders, dropdowns, or tabs were implemented using custom code.
Performance optimization and web accessibility practices, including ARIA attributes, were applied.

# Technologies Used
React: Main framework for building the webpage.
CSS3: For styling the components.
HTML5: For structuring the components.
JavaScript (ES6+): For interactivity and logic.
React Hooks: For managing state and lifecycle methods.
Flexbox & Grid: For responsive layout design.
ARIA Roles and Accessibility: To enhance the page's usability for all users.

# Challenges and Approach

## Layout and Responsiveness
1. The primary challenge was ensuring that the layout adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes. To tackle this:
2. Flexbox and Grid were used for structuring layouts.
3. Media queries were used to handle different breakpoints.
Interactivity
4. For dropdowns, sliders, and other interactive elements, I avoided third-party plugins and implemented custom React components.

## Performance Optimization
1. Images were optimized for faster loading.
2. The page was designed to be lightweight by minimizing JavaScript and CSS usage.

## Bonus Enhancements
1. Hover Effects: Added subtle animations to buttons and links for a more engaging user experience.
